    "description": "Information about movesession.  <br/>  <br/>  A customer environment is often ever-changing, and as a result the ability to   deliver business continuity and flexibility is paramount. The new local LUN migration   feature address this concern, by adding the ability to move LUNs and Consistency Groups   between Pools on a system. Local LUN migration can be used to rebalance storage resources   across Pools when customer activity changes and an individual Pool's usage becomes oversaturated.   Another use case for local LUN migration is to provide LUNs with a destination when a Pool is   to be decommissioned. By leveraging Unity's Transparent Data Transfer (TDX) engine, host access   remains fully online during the migration session.",
